Software Engineers can expect above-average
job opportunities. As the demand for software
grows across the world, the need for software
engineers continues to increase. Developing
and testing applications, software engineers
can find employment in cyber security,
healthcare systems development, mobile
application development and embedded
software development. Embedded software is
also referred to as firmware and is used to
control the behavior of electronic appliances
such as cars, toasters and GPS devices.
 
Computer science has grown exponentially from
its beginnings as a simple, mechanical method
for solving arithmetic equations to its current
dominance over everyday life. With the proper
education  and training, there is almost no
limit to the types of jobs one can get as a
software engineer.
